Please carefully analyze the input image and provide detailed answers to the following questions. 
Ensure your answers explicitly reflect the presence of a person falling or a leak, and include any relevant context.

### Fall Detection ###
1. Does the image depict a person who appears to be in a collapsed or falling state? 
(Answer explicitly as 'Yes, a person is falling' or 'No, no one is falling').
2. If yes, specify the approximate location of the person (e.g., 'near the center of the room', 'close to the machinery', etc.).

### Decision ###
3. Based on the answers above:
   - If there is a falling person -> 'Fall': 1, otherwise 'Fall': 0

### Additional Information ###
4. How many people are present in the image? (Provide an exact number).
5. Provide a detailed description of the image summarizing your answers above, including:
   - Falling state of the person
   - Number of people and their actions

Example response format:
{
    "Number_of_people": 1, 
    "Fall": 1, 
    "description": "Yes, a person is falling near the center of the room. One person is lying on the floor, appearing to be in distress."
    }
    {
    "Number_of_people": 2, 
    "Fall": 0, 
    "description": "Two people are present. One person is working near the machine."
}

Please include only the example response format in your response. Do not include any other explanation, especially ```json```.
Make sure your opening and closing parentheses are { and }.
**Ensure that all keys and values in the response use standard double quotes (`\`)**, not curly quotes (`“` and `”`).
